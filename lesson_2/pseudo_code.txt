1. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a
   string that is all those strings concatenated together

Define a method that accepts a single array of strings as parameter.
Within that method:
  - Set a variable to an empty string.
  - Iterate through the array of strings and concatenate
    each string to the end of the empty string variable.
  - Return the variable.

START

# Given an array of strings

SET long_string = ''
FOR each word in string array:
  long_string += word
RETURN long_string

END

2. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new 
   array with every other element from the original array, starting 
   with the first element.

   Define a method which takes a single array of integers as parameter.
   Within that method:
    - Set a variable to an empty array and a counter to zero.
    - Iterate through the integer array, using the counter to access
      the elements of the array.
    - Increment the counter by two after each loop
    - Return the new integer array

START

# Given an array of integers

SET every_other = []
SET counter = 0

WHILE counter <= integer_array.size
  append integer_array[counter] to every_other
  counter += 2

RETURN every_other

END

3. A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given 
   character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' 
   and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index 
   of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, 
   return nil. 

Define a method which takes a string and a single character as parameter.
Within that method:
  - Set a counter and an index counter both to zero.
  - Iterate through the string, comparing each individiual character to
    the given character.
  - If the two characters are found to be equal, increment the counter.
  - After each comparison, check if the counter is equal to three.
    - If it is not equal to three, increment the index counter
    - If it is equal to three, return the index counter.
  - If after iterating through the entire string, if counter is less than three:
   - Return nil.

START

# Given a string and a single character

SET counter = 0
SET index = 0

WHILE index < string.length
  counter += 1 IF string[index] == character
  IF counter == 3
    RETURN index
  ELSE
    index += 1

RETURN nil

END

4. A method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of 
   merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the 
   elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements 
   of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.

Define a method which takes two arrays as parameter.
Within that method:
  - Set an index counter to zero.
  - Set a variable called 'merged' to reference an empty array.
  - Using the index counter to access the elements of each array:
    - Append element at array1[counter] to the merged array.
    - Append element at array2[counter] to the merged array.
  - Continue until the value of the index counter exceeds the size
    of the first array.
  - Return the merged array.

START

# Given two arrays of equal size

SET index = 0
SET merged = []

WHILE index < array1.length
  merged << array1[index]
  merged << array2[index]

return merged

END
