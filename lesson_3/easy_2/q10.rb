# Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align
# things on the screen. If we had a table of flintstones
# family members that was forty characters in width, how
# could we easily center this title variable above the table 
# with spaces?

title = "Flintstones Family Members"
puts title.center(40)
puts '-' * 40
